                In the beginning, I would code as long as my head could take. While that’s not the best strategy, I knew I had to do it because my learning curve was steep.

                I used Treehouse to learn the fundamentals. It gave me a clear roadmap. 
                While I didn’t finish the course, I learned enough to start small projects.

                After Treehouse, I would just code for 3-4 hours in the morning while simultaneously building projects. I would code for less hours due to frustration. 
                Sometimes I would get stuck on problems for so long it made me want to stop for the day.

                This trend continues to this day. I still get frustrated, but I feel more productive coding for 3-4 hours a day. 
                Sometimes I’ll code for 3 hours straight, and do 1 hour later in the afternoon.

                Other times I’ll split coding sessions into 2 sets. For those who want to learn code, I recommend whatever works best for you.
